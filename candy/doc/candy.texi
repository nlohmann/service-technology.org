@chapter First Steps

@section Setup and Installation

@enumerate
@item Go to @url{http://service-technology.org/files/candy} and download the latest release version of Candy, say @file{candy-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz}. To setup and compile Candy, change into your download directory and type

@cartouche
@smallexample
tar xfz candy-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
cd candy-@value{VERSION}
./configure
make
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

After compilation, a binary @samp{src/candy} is generated.@footnote{On Microsoft Windows, the file will be called @file{candy.exe}.} If you experience any compiler warnings, don't panic: Candy contains some generated or third party code that we cannot influence.

@item To test whether everything went fine, type

@cartouche
@smallexample
make check
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

to execute the testcases located in @file{tests}. If everything went fine, you
should see something like:@footnote{Some tests use Wendy to check whether the
calculated operating guidelines are correct. If Wendy was not found by the configure script, theses tests are skipped.}

@smallexample
## ------------- ##
## Test results. ##
## ------------- ##

All 32 tests were successful.
@end smallexample

If an error occurs, please send the output to @email{candy@@service-technology.org}.

@item To install the binary, the manpage, and the documentation, type

@cartouche
@smallexample
make install
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

You might need superuser permissions to do so.
@end enumerate

If you need any further information, see file @file{INSTALL} for detailed instructions.


@section Contents of the Distribution

The distribution contains several directories:

@table @file
@item doc
The Texinfo documentation of Candy. The documentation can be created using
@samp{make pdf}. Note you need to have Candy properly installed before (see installation description above).

@item man
The manpage of Candy which can be displayed using @samp{man candy} after having
Candy installed (see installation description above).

@item src
The source code of Candy.

@item tests
Testcases for Candy which check the generated binary. Some test scripts use
Wendy to calculated operating guidelines. If
Wendy was not found by the configure script, theses tests are skipped.
@end table

@node ChangeLog
@chapter Version History

@c !!! DO NOT CHANGE THE NEXT LINE -- IT IS USED AS A FILTER IN SCRIPTS !!!
Candy is developed under the ``Release Early, Release Often'' maxime (see @url{http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html}): Whenever enough integrated or a non-trivial changes have summed up, a new version is published. Though this releases might now always mark significant changes, they at least allow to quickly fix bugs and avoid infinite procrastination.
