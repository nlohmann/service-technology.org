@node Setup and Installation
@chapter Setup and Installation

The distribution environment of BPEL2oWFN was created using the
GNU Autotools. If you are familiar with the setup and installation
procedure of any GNU tool you may skip this section.





@section Setup
To setup the installation environment and to compile BPEL2oWFN simply
follow these steps:

@enumerate
@item Unpack the source tarball by entering@footnote{Cygwin users should open a
@code{tcsh}-shell before.}

@cartouche
@smallexample
gunzip bpel2owfn-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
tar xf bpel2owfn-@value{VERSION}.tar
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

@item Enter that directory:
@cartouche
@smallexample
cd bpel2owfn-@value{VERSION}
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

@item Run the configure shell script which attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation. It uses those
values to create a @file{Makefile} in each directory of the package. Entering

@cartouche
@smallexample
./configure
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

should lead to an output like:

@smallexample
checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
checking whether build environment is sane... yes
checking for a thread-safe mkdir -p... /usr/bin/mkdir -p
checking for gawk... gawk
checking whether make sets $(MAKE)... yes

config.status: creating src/bpel2owfn.h
config.status: executing depfiles commands
@end smallexample

In some cases the configure script complains (i.e.@: warns) about tools which
could not be found in your system path. In this case please check
@ref{Tool Dependencies}. BPEL2oWFN can be compiled without these tools.
However, you cannot make changes to large parts of the programm as you will not
be able to generate source files without the tools.

@item After all Makefiles are created, run

@cartouche
@smallexample
make
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

to compile the executable binary as well as a documentation file.

@item Alternatively, you can run

@cartouche
@smallexample
make check
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

to self-test the created binary. After many lines of output@footnote{Unless
the test script displays error messages warnings of BPEL2oWFN can be
ignored.} @code{make check} should announce

@smallexample
==================
All 6 tests passed
==================
@end smallexample

or, if anything went wrong, prints error message and requests to report the
encountered bug to @email{bug-bpel2owfn@@gnu.org}.
@end enumerate





@section Installation

@ignore
The compilation BPEL2oWFN is controlled by several Makefiles. Make
sure that all required programs (see @ref{Required Programs}) are reachable in
your path. To compile BPEL2oWFN, just run @samp{make}.
@end ignore

After successful compilation and self tests an executable file @file{bpel2owfn}
(or @file{bpel2owfn.exe} on systems running Microsoft Windows) is created in
the directory @file{bpel2owfn-@value{VERSION}/src} of the distribution. This
file has no dependencies to other files of the distribution and can be copied
to any directory.

Alternatively you can install BPEL2oWFN properly by executing
@footnote{Usually, @samp{make install} and @samp{make uninstall} can only be
executed by the root user.}

@cartouche
@smallexample
make install
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

to copy the binary to the directory @file{/usr/local/bin} and to make the
documentation accessible (i.e.@: copy it to @file{/usr/local/info}) for

@cartouche
@smallexample
info bpel2owfn
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

You can undo the installation by entering

@cartouche
@smallexample
make uninstall
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

The setup and installation procedure can be customized by running
@code{./configure} with several command-line options. Type

@cartouche
@smallexample
./configure --help
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

for more information.





@section Problems during Setup or Installation

Any warning during an in other respects successful compilation can be
ignored --- these warnings mostly occur in generated files from Flex, Bison or
Kimwitu++ and are outside of our scope.

The compilation of BPEL2oWFN was tested on several operating systems
such as Microsoft Windows (running Cygwin), GNU/Linux, Apple Mac OS X
and Sun Solaris. Anyway, if the compilation fails please make sure you use the
most recent (stable) versions of the GNU Compiler Collection. If this
does not help please send us an electronic mail to
@email{bug-bpel2owfn@@gnu.org}. Include the version number of your
distribution (version @value{VERSION} of @value{UPDATED}). Also include in your
message the output that the make process produced. We will try to answer your
mail within a week.

If you are not interested in compiling BPEL2oWFN yourself you can
alternatively download executable binaries for several operating systems on the
website of BPEL2oWFN (@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/bpel2owfn}).





@section Makefile Targets

The generated Makefiles serve different targets:

@table @code
@item all

Compile BPEL2oWFN and create an executable binary @file{bpel2owfn}
(or @file{bpel2owfn.exe} on systems running Microsoft Windows) in the directory
@file{bpel2owfn-@value{VERSION}/src}.

@item dvi
@itemx html
@itemx pdf
@itemx ps

Generate documentation files in the given format which can be @acronym{DVI},
@acronym{HTML}, @acronym{PDF} or PostScript. The documentation is generated
in the directory @file{bpel2owfn-@value{VERSION}/doc} and is named
@file{bpel2owfn.@var{format}} (User's Manual).

@item clean

Clean all temporary files created during the compilation. Executables as well
as generated documentation are preserved.

@item distclean

Clean also source files generated by the compiler generator tools (Flex, Bison
and Kimwitu++). Executables as well as created documentation files are also
removed. Before re-compilation you have to run @samp{./configure} again. Please note
that after running @samp{make distclean} you need the tools described in
@ref{Tool Dependencies} to compile.

@item check

Perform a number of self-tests: the directory @file{tests} contains several
@acronym{BPEL} processes which are read and compiled.

@end table

@node Tool Dependencies
@chapter Tool Dependencies

@anchor{Required Programs}
@section Required Programs

To compile BPEL2oWFN you do not need any specific program other than
the GNU Compiler Collection. If you however want to change the
program (e.g. add new Petri net patterns) you need the following programs to
generate source code. These programs are (as BPEL2oWFN itself) free
software distributed under the GNU General Public License.


@table @asis
@item @b{Flex}, A fast scanner generator
Flex is needed to generate the lexer of BPEL2oWFN. Flex was written
by Vern Paxon. Copyright @copyright{} 1990 The Regents of the University of
California. All rights reserved. Flex is available under
@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/flex.html}.

@item @b{Bison}, The @acronym{YACC}-compatible Parser Generator
Bison is needed to generate the parser of BPEL2oWFN. Bison was
written by Robert Corbett und Richard Stallman. Copyright @copyright{} 1992,
1998, 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005 Free Software Foundation, Inc. Bison is available
under @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/bison.html}.

@item @b{Kimwitu++}, The Term Processor
Kimwitu++ is needed to generate all files managing the @acronym{AST, abstract
syntax tree}. Kimwitu++ was written by Toby Neumann and Michael Piefel.
Copyright @copyright{} 1988-1997  Axel Belinfante, University of Twente.
Copyright @copyright{} 1997-2007  Michael Piefel, Humboldt-University Berlin.
Kimwitu++ is available under
@url{http://site.informatik.hu-berlin.de/kimwitu++}.
@end table





@section Optional Programs

BPEL2oWFN is a compiler and thus creating output files which can be
read by several other programs. These programs are not needed to compile
BPEL2oWFN yet without these programs BPEL2oWFN makes not
much sense.


@table @asis
@item @b{@acronym{LoLA}}, a Low Level Petri net Analyzer
@acronym{LoLA} is an explicit model checker implementing a broad variety of
reduction techniques such as partial order reduction, symmetries or the sweep
line method. @acronym{LoLA} was written by Karsten Schmidt and is available
under @url{http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~kschmidt/lola.html}.

@c @item @b{The Model-Checking Kit}
@c The Model-Checking Kit is a collection of programs which allow to model a
@c finite-state system using a variety of modelling languages, and verify it using
@c a variety of checkers, including deadlock-checkers, reachability-checkers, and
@c model-checkers for the temporal logics CTL and LTL. The Model-Checking Kit is
@c maintained by Javier Esparza, Claus Schröter and Stefan Schwoon at the
@c University of Stuttgart and is available under
@c @url{http://www.fmi.uni-stuttgart.de/szs/tools/mckit}.


@item @b{Graphviz}, the Graph Visualization Software
Graphviz is a graph visualization software with several graph layout programs
including dot. Graphviz is maintained by AT&T Labs and is available under
@url{http://www.graphviz.org}.
@end table

The Graphviz tool dot can be used to create a graphical representation of the
generated Petri net in @acronym{PNG, Portable Network Graphic} format. If dot
is not found on your system, BPEL2oWFN will only create a .dot-file
and does not try to invoke dot.




@section Supported Platforms

BPEL2oWFN is implemented in @acronym{ANSI} C and @acronym{ANSI} C++ and should
compile on nearly any platform that supports the GNU Compiler Collection.

However, we tested BPEL2oWFN on these platforms:
@itemize @bullet
@item Microsoft Windows 2000 (x86)
@item Microsoft Windows XP (x86)
@item Microsoft Vista Business (x86)
@item Apple Mac OS X Tiger (PowerPC and x86)
@item Sun Solaris 8 (@acronym{SPARC})
@item Sun Solaris 9 (@acronym{SPARC})
@item GNU/Linux (x86)
@end itemize



@section Reference System

As of @value{UPDATED-MONTH}, we use the following system developing and
building BPEL2oWFN:

@itemize
@item Apple MacBook
@item 2 GB RAM
@item Mac OS X 10.4.9 (Tiger)
@item GNU Compiler Collection 4.0.1 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 5367)
@item Flex version 2.5.33
@item GNU Bison version 2.3
@item Kimwitu++ version 2.3.11
@end itemize

The version numbers are not to be understood as system requirements, but as a
help if you fail to compile the sources.
