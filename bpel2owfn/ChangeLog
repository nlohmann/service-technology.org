Change Log
**********

Most recent version at the end of this section.

Version 1.0 (16 January 2006)
-----------------------------

   - input:
        * BPEL process compliant to the specificiation BPEL4WS version
          1.1, May 2003.

   - output:
        * LoLA Petri net

        * open workflow net

        * Dot representation

   - implemented patterns:
        * Christian Stahl. A Petri Net Semantics for BPEL.
          Informatik-Berichte 188, Humboldt-Universita"t zu Berlin,
          July 2005.

Version 1.1 (24 February 2006)
------------------------------

   - new output formats:
        * APNN (Abstract Petri Net Notation) Petri net

        * PNML (Petri Net Markup Language) Petri net

        * low-level PEP (Programming Environment based on Petri Nets)
          Petri net

   - overworked patterns:
        * the Stahl-semantics (see version 1.0) has been enhanced and
          can be parametrized:
             * original semantics

             * models without BPEL's standard faults

             * acyclic models
          For more information please refer to the User's Manual.

   - static analysis:
        * To reduce the size of the Petri net model static analysis is
          used to only generate nodes for the DPE (dead path
          elimination) when necessary.

   - miscellaneous:
        * The compiler generator tools Flex, Bison and Kimwitu++ are
          not any more necessary to compile GNU BPEL2oWFN: the
          generated sources are now part of the distrubution.

        * The oWFN format was overworked and allows final markings.

        * GNU getopt allows more flexible command-line parameter
          processing allowing to create several output file formats in
          a single run.

        * Debug output can be written into a log file.

        * The classes organizing the Petri nets are overworked for
          performance and extensibility.

   - fixed bugs:
        * The generation of all possible types of the `<invoke>'
          activity (synchronous, asynchronous, with and without
          implicit scope) is overworked.

Version 1.2 (6 April 2006)
--------------------------

   - overworked patterns:
        * more parameterized versions of the Stahl-semantics (see
          version 1.1):
             * acyclic models (also acyclic event handlers)

             * models without variables

             * models without standard faults occuring while handling a
               fault
          For more information please refer to the User's Manual.

   - static analysis:
        * A control flow graph can be built and used to detect the use
          of uninitialized variables.

   - miscellaneous:
        * The command-line parameter `-p finishloop' is renamed to `-p
          finalloop'.

        * Structural reduction rules remove all structural dead nodes
          of the generated Petri net model.

   - fixed bugs:
        * Pattern of asynchronous `<invoke>' activity does no longer
          receive messages.

        * Structural reduction rules no longer change the semantics of
          the `<switch>' activity.

        * Structural reduction rules no longer remove the loop
          transition for deadlock search.

Version 2.0 (6 December 2006)
-----------------------------

   - miscellaneous:
        * overworked architecture
