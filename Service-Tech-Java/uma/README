PURPOSE
    UMA (an Unfolding-based Model Analyzer) has been implemented for the
    validation of state-space construction techniques for place/transition
    net state spaces and scenario-based specifications. Its particular
    strengths include
    
     * a compact representation of a system's state-space based on McMillan's
       technique of finite complete prefixes of Petri net unfoldings;
     * applicable to scenario-based models with history-based enabling conditions; 
     * techniques to transform and change model structures based on their
       unfoldings.

    UMA is platform independent and runs on all platforms with a Java runtime
    environment.

INSTALLATION (to be done)
    UMA can be easily compiled and installed. See file "INSTALL" for
    instructions.

    UMA uses some generated code. If you want to make changes to the source
    code, you might need the following tools to regenerate the code:
     * ???
     
    UMA uses some external libraries to run. The SVN repository sources do
    not contain these external libraries. UMA's ant file is designed to
    collect these libraries for you and place them at the right locations.
    However, if this fails, you may have to obtain and places the following
    libraries manually:
    
    * PNAPI/Java 
      obtain the latest copy from svn://svn.gna.org/svn/service-tech/trunk,
      there, run "ant jar" to generate the file ./build/pnapi-java.jar; put
      this file to <uma-root>/libs-external/pnapi-java.jar
