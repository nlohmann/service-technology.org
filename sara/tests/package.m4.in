# AUTOTEST PACKAGE CONFIGURATION FILE                                        #

# This file configures the Autotest test suite (usually file testsuite.at). The
# configuration is read when generating the test scripts, and it is also used
# in the test cases. The variables set here are accessible in the test cases
# and usually hold the name of directories and tools.
#
# A configuration file like this usually consists of three parts:
#
# 1. A generic part that contains information that is not specific for this
#    package. These information include the package's name and version, the
#    current SVN revision, the absolute directory of the test files and the
#    directory where benchmark results are written to, and the full name of
#    the executables of the standard tools grep, awk, and sed. You must not
#    change this part.
#
# 2. The main executable. This is the actual program you built in this
#    package and that you now want to check. Usually, two variables are
#    defined: The first variable "TOOL" calls the main executable through a
#    wrapper script "cover.sh". This is required when code coverage should be
#    checked. A second variable "TOOL_RAW" does not use this wrapper script.
#    This is used if the executable is analyzed, for instance using Valgrind.
#    All you need to change in this part is the name of the main tool(s) of
#    your package.
#
# 3. Several helper tools that are used in the test script. Here, we
#    distinguish two type of tools: optional tools and mandatory tools. An
#    optional tool is defined by prefixing it with a script "wrap.sh". If the
#    tool was not found, an exit code is return to the calling test script that
#    yields skipping the current test case. Mandatory tools are called without
#    this script and yield failures if the tool is not found. This part is
#    optional. Add as many tools as you need. Please make sure you define the
#    variables surrounded by @'s in the file "configure.ac". This is usually
#    done by calling "AC_PATH_PROG(MIA, [mia], not found)".
