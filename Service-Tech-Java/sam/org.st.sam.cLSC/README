PURPOSE
    SAM (our Scenario-based Analysis Methods and tools) have been implemented
    for validating various analysis, synthesis, and mining techniques for 
    scenario-based specifications. Its particular strengths include
    
     * translating scenario-based specifications to Colored Petri Nets for
       distributed play-out
     * mining scenario-based specifications from logs
     *

    SAM is platform independent and runs on all platforms with a Java runtime
    environment.
