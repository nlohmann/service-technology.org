@node Setup and Installation
@chapter Setup and Installation

The distribution environment of @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} was created using the
@acronym{GNU} Autotools. If you are familiar with the setup and installation
procedure of any @acronym{GNU} tool you may skip this section.

@section Setup
To setup the installation environment and to compile @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} simply
follow these steps:

@enumerate
@item Unpack the source tarball by entering@footnote{Cygwin users should open a
@code{tcsh}-shell before.}

@smallexample
gunzip bpel2owfn-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
tar xf bpel2owfn-@value{VERSION}.tar
@end smallexample

@item Enter that directory:
@smallexample
cd bpel2owfn-@value{VERSION}
@end smallexample

@item Run the configure shell script which attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation. It uses those
values to create a @file{Makefile} in each directory of the package. Entering

@smallexample
./configure
@end smallexample

should lead to an output like:

@cartouche
@smallexample
checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
checking whether build environment is sane... yes
checking for gawk... gawk
checking whether make sets $(MAKE)... yes
checking for g++... g++
checking for C++ compiler default output file name... a.exe
checking whether the C++ compiler works... yes
checking whether we are cross compiling... no
checking for suffix of executables... .exe
checking for suffix of object files... o
checking whether we are using the GNU C++ compiler... yes
checking whether g++ accepts -g... yes
checking for style of include used by make... GNU
checking dependency style of g++... gcc3
checking for gcc... gcc
checking whether we are using the GNU C compiler... yes
checking whether gcc accepts -g... yes
checking for gcc option to accept ANSI C... none needed
checking dependency style of gcc... gcc3
checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
checking for flex... flex
checking for yywrap in -lfl... yes
checking lex output file root... lex.yy
checking whether yytext is a pointer... no
checking for bison... bison
checking for kc++... kc++
configure: creating ./config.status
config.status: creating Makefile
config.status: creating doc/Makefile
config.status: creating src/Makefile
config.status: creating tests/Makefile
config.status: creating src/bpel2owfn.h
config.status: executing depfiles commands
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

In some cases the configure script complains (i.e.@: warns) about tools which
could not be found in your system path. In this case please check
@ref{Needed Programs}. @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} can be compiled without these tools.
However, you cannot make changes to large parts of the programm as you will not
be able to generate source files without the tools.

@item After all Makefiles are created, run

@smallexample
make
@end smallexample

to compile the executable binary as well as a documentation file.

@item Alternatively, you can run

@smallexample
make check
@end smallexample

to self-test the created binary. After many lines of output @code{make check}
should announce

@cartouche
@smallexample
PASS: test1
PASS: test2
PASS: test3
==================
All 3 tests passed
==================
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

or, if anything went wrong, prints error message and requests to report the
encountered bug to @email{nlohmann@@informatik.hu-berlin.de}.
@end enumerate

@section Installation

@ignore
The compilation @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} is controlled by several Makefiles. Make
sure that all required programs (see @ref{Required Programs}) are reachable in
your path. To compile @acronym{BPEL2oWFN}, just run @samp{make}.
@end ignore

After successful compilation and self tests an executable file @file{bpel2owfn}
(or @file{bpel2owfn.exe} on systems running Microsoft Windows) is created in
the directory @file{bpel2owfn-@value{VERSION}/src} of the distribution. This
file has no dependencies to other files of the distribution and can be copied
to any directory.

Alternatively you can install @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} properly by executing
@footnote{Usually, @samp{make install} and @samp{make uninstall} can only be
executed by the root user.}

@smallexample
make install
@end smallexample

to copy the binary to the directory @file{/usr/local/bin} and to make the
documentation accessible (i.e.@: copy it to @file{/usr/local/info}) for

@smallexample
info bpel2owfn
@end smallexample

You can undo the installation by entering

@smallexample
make uninstall
@end smallexample

The setup and installation procedure can be customized by running
@code{./configure} with several command-line options. Type

@smallexample
./configure --help
@end smallexample

for more information.


@section Problems during Setup or Installation

Any warning during an in other respects successful compilation can be
ignored --- these warnings mostly occur in generated files from Flex, Bison or
Kimwitu++ and are outside of our scope.

The compilation of @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} was tested on several operating systems
such as Microsoft Windows (running Cygwin), Linux, Apple MacOS X and Sun OS.
Anyway, if the compilation fails please make sure you use the most recent
(stable) versions of the @acronym{GNU} Compiler Collection, Flex, Bison and
Kimwitu++. If this does not help please send us an electronic mail to
@email{nlohmann@@informatik.hu-berlin.de}. Include the version number of your
distribution (version @value{VERSION} of @value{UPDATED}). Also include in your
message the output that the make process produced. We will try to answer your
mail within a week.

If you are not interested in compiling @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} yourself you can
alternatively download executable binaries for several operating systems on the
website of @acronym{BPEL2oWFN}
(@url{http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/top/tools4bpel/bpel2owfn}).



@section Makefile Targets

The generated Makefiles serve different targets:

@table @code
@item all
Compile @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} and create an executable binary @file{bpel2owfn}
(or @file{bpel2owfn.exe} on systems running Microsoft Windows) in the directory
@file{bpel2owfn-@value{VERSION}/src}.

@item dvi
@itemx html
@itemx pdf
@itemx ps
Generate documentation files in the given format which can be @acronym{DVI},
@acronym{HTML}, @acronym{PDF} or PostScript. The documentation is generated
in the directory @file{bpel2owfn-@value{VERSION}/doc} and is named
@file{bpel2owfn.@var{format}} (User's Manual).

@item clean
Clean all temporary files created during the compilation. Executables as well
as generated documentation are preserved.

@item distclean
Clean also source files generated by the compiler generator tools (Flex, Bison
and Kimwitu++). Executables as well as created documentation files are also
removed. To re-compile you have to run @samp{./configure} again. Please note
that afer running @samp{make distclean} you need the tools described in
@ref{Needed Programs} to compile.

@item check
Perform a number of self-tests: the directory @file{tests} contains several
@acronym{BPEL} processes which are read and compiled.

@item pure-windows-executable
Create an executable binary which is independent of the Cygwin libraries. This
file can be executed on any system running Microsoft Windows, independently of
a Cygwin environment.

@anchor{Required Programs}
@section Required Programs

To compile @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} you do not need any specific program other than
the @acronym{GNU} Compiler Collection. If you however want to change the
program (e.g. add new Petri net patterns) you need the following programs to
generate source code. These programs are (as @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} itself) free
software distributed under the @acronym{GNU} General Public License.

@section Optional Programs

@acronym{BPEL2oWFN} is a compiler and thus creating output files which can be
read by several other programs. These programs are not needed to compile
@acronym{BPEL2oWFN} yet without these programs @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} makes not
much sense.


@table @asis
@item @b{@acronym{LoLA}}, a Low Level Petri net Analyzer
@acronym{LoLA} is an explicit model checker implementing a broad variety of
reduction techniques such as partial order reduction, symmetries or the sweep
line method. @acronym{LoLA} was written by Karsten Schmidt and is available

@item @b{The Model-Checking Kit}
The Model-Checking Kit is a collection of programs which allow to model a
finite-state system using a variety of modelling languages, and verify it using
a variety of checkers, including deadlock-checkers, reachability-checkers, and
model-checkers for the temporal logics CTL and LTL. The Model-Checking Kit is
maintained by Javier Esparza, Claus Schröter and Stefan Schwoon at the
University of Stuttgart and is available under
@url{http://www.fmi.uni-stuttgart.de/szs/tools/mckit}.


@item @b{Graphviz}, the Graph Visualization Software
